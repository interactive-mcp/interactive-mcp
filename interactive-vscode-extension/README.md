## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Install the Extension

1. Open your VS Code-based editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Interactive MCP"
4. Click Install

### Step 2: Get Your Configuration

After installation, click "Copy MCP JSON Configuration" from the welcome notification or use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to find "Interactive MCP: Copy MCP JSON Configuration".

### Step 3: Configure Your AI Assistant

1. Find your AI assistant's MCP configuration file (varies by assistant)

2. Add the copied configuration to the `mcpServers` section:
   
   **If this is your first MCP server:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       // Paste your copied configuration here
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **If you already have other MCP servers:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "existing-server": {
         // your existing server config
       },
       // Paste your copied configuration here (adds "interactive-mcp" entry)
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart your AI assistant

**Note on Updates:** If you update the extension, you may need to update the path in your MCP JSON config file. Use the command palette ("Interactive MCP: Copy MCP JSON Configuration") to get the latest configuration and update your file accordingly.
